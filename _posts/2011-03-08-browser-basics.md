Browser Basics: What is a web browser?
======================================

Its important to understand that there are three basic parts to accessing the internet.

The first is your *operating system* (OS), this is what makes your computer run.

The second is your *web browser*, which connects to the internet and displays web pages.

The third is the *internet* itself, which isn't a single piece of software, and isn't something you can install, like a web browser. The internet is a group of protocols and software that all work together to bring you google.com or let you shop at amazon.com.

Operating systems
-----------------

Everyone knows the name of a few operating systems, but may not know what they do and don't do. Chances are you're running Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7, or for Apple users OS X. Each of these is a different operating system, but each plays the same role: allowing any kind of software to use your computer hardware.

Operating systems allow you to run _applications_, or programs. Besides your web browser, some common applications are:

* Word, Excel and Powerpoint (also known as MS Office)
* Windows Media Player for music and videos
* Notepad
* Outlook for email

Browsers
--------

A web browser is a program that runs on your operating system. Almost all are free, but quality varies. Internet Explorer comes installed on new computers, but older versions aren't safe for everyday use.

All web browsers have a simple role: connect to the internet and display web pages for you; *thats it*. Everything else is either your operating system or another program.

The Internet
------------

At its simplest, the internet is like the air travel system. Its a large collection of connections (flights) between different computers (airports), with a large set of rules about how air travel must work.

Google
------

Google is a *search engine*, which is _not_ the same thing as the internet. Google simple allows you to find what you want on the internet, and then go there, just like a map.
